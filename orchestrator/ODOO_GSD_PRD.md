# odoo-gsd: Product Requirements Document

## Fork of GSD → Odoo ERP Module Orchestrator

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-03-05
**Author:** TIFAQM Engineering

---

## 1. Executive Summary

odoo-gsd is a fork of GSD (Get Shit Done) — a Claude Code project management extension — specialized for orchestrating Odoo ERP module generation at scale. It takes a university ERP PRD, decomposes it into 20+ modules, and drives the Odoo-Development-Automation belt (odoo-gen) to produce production-ready Odoo modules with cross-module coherence.

### Architecture

```
odoo-gsd (FORK of GSD — this repo)
  │  Orchestrates module decomposition, dependency ordering,
  │  cross-module state (model registry), human checkpoints
  │
  └── odoo-gen (UNCHANGED — separate repo, GSD extension → becomes odoo-gsd extension)
        │  Single-module generation pipeline
        │  8 agents, 13 knowledge files, Jinja2 templates, Docker validation
        │
        └── odoo-gen-utils (Python CLI, called from within odoo-gen agents)
              AST analysis, ChromaDB search, MCP server, Docker ops
```

**Key relationship:** odoo-gen currently extends GSD. After forking, odoo-gen's install references change from `~/.claude/odoo-gsd/` to `~/.claude/odoo-gsd/`. odoo-gen itself stays in its own repo, untouched except for this path change.

## 2. GSD Codebase Structure (Pre-Fork Baseline)

The GSD repo contains ~110 files across these directories:

### 2.1 CLI Tooling

| File | Purpose | Fork Action |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `bin/odoo-gsd-tools.cjs` | Main CLI router (~2,000+ lines). Dispatches to lib modules. Handles JSON output, `@file:` temp payloads, `--raw` mode. | **Rename** entry points from `gsd` to `odoo-gsd`. Add new subcommands for registry, module-status, computation-chains. Extend `main()` router with new command handlers. |
| `bin/lib/core.js` | State reading/writing, config management, project init | **Extend** with model registry CRUD, module status tracking, computation chain management. Add `odoo` config block parsing. |
| `bin/lib/commands.js` | Command registration, dispatch, help generation | **Modify** command prefix from `gsd` to `odoo-gsd`. Register new commands (new-erp, map-erp, discuss-module, plan-module, generate-module, check-module, audit-erp). |
| `bin/lib/phase.js` | Phase CRUD, transitions, status tracking | **Extend** to support module-as-phase semantics. Each Odoo module maps to a GSD phase. Add module dependency ordering within phase transitions. |
| `bin/lib/roadmap.js` | ROADMAP.md parsing, phase detail sections | **Extend** parser to understand module dependency tiers (foundation → core → operations → communication) and wave-based execution mapping. |
| `bin/lib/state.js` | STATE.md frontmatter read/write, status sync | **Extend** with module-level state fields (current_module, modules_completed, modules_remaining, registry_version). |
| `bin/lib/config.js` | `.planning/config.json` read/write, schema validation | **Extend** schema with `odoo` block (version, multi_company, localization, belt_repo_path, default_depends, security_framework, scope_levels, notification_channels, canvas_integration). |
| `bin/lib/frontmatter.js` | YAML frontmatter manipulation | **Keep as-is.** |
| `bin/lib/verify.js` | Verification logic, pass/fail tracking | **Extend** with Odoo-specific verification: model registry consistency check, cross-module Many2one validation, security scope completeness. |
| `bin/install.js` | Installer (~1,400 lines). Multi-runtime support, path replacement, hook registration, manifest generation. | **Heavy rewrite.** Change package name to `odoo-gsd`. Change install path to `~/.claude/odoo-gsd/`. Remove OpenCode/Gemini/Codex runtime support (Claude Code only). Add odoo-gen dependency check (verify `~/.claude/odoo-gen/` exists). Add Python dependency check (odoo-gen-utils). |

### 2.2 Commands (`commands/gsd/*.md`)

GSD has 32 command files. Each is a markdown file with frontmatter defining the slash command and body containing the orchestration instructions.

#### Commands to HEAVY REWRITE (new Odoo-specific logic)

| GSD Command File | New Name | What Changes |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| `commands/gsd/new-project.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/new-erp.md` | Replace generic project questions with Odoo-specific init: version, multi-company, localization, module count, existing modules, LMS integration, notification channels, deployment target. Spawn 4 parallel research agents (module boundary analysis, OCA registry check, cross-module dependency mapping, computation chain identification). Output: module dependency graph with phased generation order, not generic roadmap. |
| `commands/gsd/map-codebase.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/map-erp.md` | Replace generic codebase scanning with 4 Odoo-specific agents: manifest parser (`__manifest__.py` → dependency graph), model AST analyzer (fields, methods, inheritance → registry), security scanner (`ir.model.access.csv` + record rules), view pattern detector (XML → tabs, smart buttons, kanban). Output: `model_registry.json` + `erp_map.md`. Can also use odoo-gen's MCP server for live XML-RPC introspection of running instances. |
| `commands/gsd/plan-phase.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/plan-module.md` | Replace generic planning with spec.json generation. Spawn odoo-spec-generator agent to produce structured spec (models, business_rules, computation_chains, workflow, view_hints, reports, notifications, cron_jobs, security, portal, api_endpoints). Inject `_available_models` from registry. Run cross-module coherence check before human approval: Many2one targets exist, computation chain depends match, security scope fields present, no duplicate model names. |
| `commands/gsd/execute-phase.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/generate-module.md` | Replace generic execution with belt invocation. Load spec.json, inject current model registry, spawn odoo-gen pipeline as `Task()` subagent with fresh 200K context. Belt runs multi-pass pipeline (scaffold → models → views → logic → security → reports → tests → validate). On success: update model registry atomically, git commit. On failure: present errors with retry/manual-fix/skip options. |
| `commands/gsd/verify-work.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/check-module.md` | Replace generic verification with 4-level checker: CHK-01 structural (Many2one targets, ACLs, mail.thread, syntax), CHK-02 cross-module (foreign keys, computed chains, security scopes, dependency graph), CHK-03 spec coverage (manifest vs spec — implemented vs stubbed), CHK-04 integration (Docker install, run tests across boundaries). Structured pass/fail for human sign-off. |
| `commands/gsd/audit-milestone.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/audit-erp.md` | Replace generic audit with full ERP audit: Docker install all modules together, run integration tests across boundaries, trace computation chains end-to-end, verify security scopes, check portal route conflicts, validate cron jobs reference existing methods, production readiness checklist. |

#### Commands to MEDIUM REWRITE (adapt to module context)

| GSD Command File | New Name | What Changes |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| `commands/gsd/discuss-phase.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/discuss-module.md` | Replace generic discussion with module-type-specific question templates. Spawn odoo-module-questioner agent with module type context. Fee module: monetary vs float, fee structure, penalty method, payment channels, challan format, partial payments, waivers, scholarships. Exam module: grading scales, makeup policy, proctoring. Student module: enrollment states, program transfers, academic holds. Output: `{module}-CONTEXT.md`. |
| `commands/gsd/complete-milestone.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/complete-phase.md` | Add: registry archival (snapshot model_registry.json at completion), release tagging per module tier, update module_status.json to "shipped". |
| `commands/gsd/progress.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/progress.md` | Add: module status table (planned/spec_approved/generated/checked/shipped), registry stats (total models, total fields, cross-module references), computation chain completion status, overall ERP readiness percentage. |
| `commands/gsd/quick.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/quick.md` | Add: quick field addition (add field to existing generated module + update registry), quick bug fix (fix without full cycle), quick view modification. Must update registry on any model change. |

#### Commands to LIGHT REWRITE (rename prefix, minimal changes)

| GSD Command File | New Name | What Changes |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| `commands/gsd/pause-work.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/pause-work.md` | Rename prefix only. Add: save current module context on pause. |
| `commands/gsd/resume-work.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/resume-work.md` | Rename prefix only. Add: reload model registry on resume. |
| `commands/gsd/help.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/help.md` | Update help text with Odoo-specific commands and workflow description. |
| `commands/gsd/add-todo.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/add-todo.md` | Rename prefix only. |
| `commands/gsd/debug.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/debug.md` | Rename prefix only. Add: Odoo-specific debug context (check Docker logs, pylint-odoo output, model registry state). |
| `commands/gsd/settings.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/settings.md` | Rename prefix. Add `odoo` config block editing (version, multi_company, localization, etc.). |
| `commands/gsd/set-profile.md` | `commands/odoo-gsd/set-profile.md` | Rename prefix only. |

#### All remaining GSD commands

Rename prefix from `/odoo-gsd:` to `/odoo-gsd:`. Keep behavior. This includes any utility commands, status commands, transition commands, etc. not listed above.

### 2.3 Agents (`agents/*.md`)

GSD has ~12 agent prompt files. Each defines a persona with role, constraints, and output format.

#### Agents to REWRITE for Odoo context

| GSD Agent | New Name | What Changes |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `agents/researcher.md` | `agents/researcher.md` | Specialize for Odoo research: OCA module registry, Odoo documentation, field type patterns, common ERP patterns. Keep research methodology (3+ sources, citation, conflict resolution) but add Odoo knowledge base references. |
| `agents/planner.md` | `agents/planner.md` | Specialize for Odoo module planning: spec.json structure, model decomposition, dependency analysis, wave-based execution. Keep planning methodology (waves, task granularity, dependency tracking) but output spec.json instead of PLAN.md. |
| `agents/executor.md` | `agents/executor.md` | Specialize for belt orchestration: loading spec.json, injecting registry, invoking odoo-gen agents, collecting manifests. The actual code generation stays in odoo-gen — this agent coordinates. |
| `agents/reviewer.md` | `agents/reviewer.md` | Specialize for Odoo review: model naming conventions, security patterns, view structure, Python code quality (pylint-odoo rules). Keep review methodology (pass/fail, actionable feedback) but apply Odoo standards. |
| `agents/verifier.md` | `agents/verifier.md` | Specialize for Odoo verification: Docker install test, cross-module reference validation, computation chain tracing, security scope completeness. Keep goal-backward verification pattern. |

#### Agents to KEEP as-is

| GSD Agent | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| `agents/debugger.md` | Generic debugging works for Odoo too. May add Odoo-specific debug hints (Docker logs, pylint-odoo, XML validation). |
| `agents/questioner.md` | Keep as base, but odoo-module-questioner replaces it for module discussions. |

#### NEW Agents (not in GSD)

| New Agent | Purpose | Format Pattern |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `agents/odoo-module-researcher.md` | PRD decomposition: analyze PRD text, identify module boundaries, detect OCA overlaps, map computation chains, output dependency graph. Spawned by `/odoo-gsd:new-erp`. | Follow GSD agent format: role definition, constraints, input/output specification, tool usage instructions. |
| `agents/odoo-spec-generator.md` | Generate spec.json from module CONTEXT + RESEARCH + registry. Knows Odoo model patterns, field types, security patterns, view patterns. Spawned by `/odoo-gsd:plan-module`. | Same format. Include spec.json schema as reference in prompt. |
| `agents/odoo-coherence-checker.md` | Cross-module validation: Many2one target existence, computation chain integrity, security scope consistency, duplicate detection. Runs against model_registry.json. Spawned by `/odoo-gsd:plan-module` and `/odoo-gsd:check-module`. | Same format. Input: spec.json + model_registry.json. Output: structured pass/fail with specific violations. |
| `agents/odoo-module-questioner.md` | Module-type-specific questions. Knows what to ask for fee modules vs exam modules vs student modules vs HR modules. Spawned by `/odoo-gsd:discuss-module`. | Same format. Include question templates per module type. |
| `agents/odoo-erp-decomposer.md` | Master decomposition agent: reads full PRD, outputs module list with dependency tiers, estimated complexity, and generation order. Spawned by `/odoo-gsd:new-erp`. | Same format. Output: structured JSON with modules, tiers, dependencies. |
| `agents/odoo-audit-agent.md` | Full ERP audit: Docker install all, integration test orchestration, computation chain end-to-end tracing, production checklist generation. Spawned by `/odoo-gsd:audit-erp`. | Same format. |

### 2.4 Workflows (`workflows/*.md`)

GSD has ~30 workflow files. These are multi-step orchestration scripts.

#### Workflows to REWRITE

| GSD Workflow | New Name | What Changes |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| `workflows/new-project.md` | `workflows/new-erp.md` | Replace generic flow with: (1) Odoo config questions → write config.json with `odoo` block, (2) Spawn 4 parallel research agents on PRD, (3) Merge research → module dependency graph, (4) Human reviews decomposition, (5) Generate ROADMAP.md with module tiers as phases, each module as a phase detail section. |
| `workflows/plan-phase.md` | `workflows/plan-module.md` | Replace with: (1) Load module CONTEXT.md + RESEARCH.md + model_registry.json, (2) Spawn odoo-spec-generator to produce spec.json, (3) Spawn odoo-coherence-checker to validate spec against registry, (4) Present coherence report + spec to human for approval, (5) On approval: update module_status.json to "spec_approved". |
| `workflows/execute-phase.md` | `workflows/generate-module.md` | Replace with: (1) Load spec.json + model_registry.json, (2) Prepare belt invocation context (inject registry as `_available_models`), (3) Spawn odoo-gen pipeline as `Task()` with fresh context, (4) Belt returns generation_manifest.json, (5) On success: parse manifest → update model_registry.json (add new models/fields) → atomic git commit → update module_status.json to "generated", (6) On failure: present errors, offer retry/manual-fix/skip. |
| `workflows/verify-work.md` | `workflows/check-module.md` | Replace with: (1) Run CHK-01 structural checks, (2) Run CHK-02 cross-module checks against registry, (3) Run CHK-03 spec coverage (diff manifest vs spec), (4) Run CHK-04 Docker integration (invoke odoo-gen's validate command), (5) Present structured results for human sign-off, (6) On pass: update module_status.json to "checked". |
| `workflows/discuss-phase.md` | `workflows/discuss-module.md` | Replace with: (1) Detect module type from spec name/description, (2) Spawn odoo-module-questioner with type-specific template, (3) Interactive Q&A session, (4) Write answers to {module}-CONTEXT.md. |

#### Workflows to EXTEND

| GSD Workflow | What Changes |
|--------------|-------------|
| `workflows/transition.md` | Add: after module check passes, if next module depends on this one, auto-inject updated registry into next module's context. |
| `workflows/complete-milestone.md` | Add: snapshot model_registry.json, tag release per tier, update module_status.json for all modules in tier. |
| `workflows/audit-milestone.md` → `workflows/audit-erp.md` | Major extension: Docker install all modules, integration tests, computation chain tracing, security audit, portal conflict check, cron validation, production checklist. |

#### Workflows to KEEP (rename prefix only)

All remaining workflows: pause, resume, debug-session, quick-fix, etc. Rename references from `gsd` to `odoo-gsd`.

    "2": {"name": "Core Academic", "status": "in_progress", "modules": ["uni_student", "uni_faculty", "uni_program"]},
    "3": {"name": "Operations", "status": "planned", "modules": ["uni_fee", "uni_exam", "uni_enrollment"]},

}
```

### 3.5 Per-Module Artifacts

Each module gets its own directory under `.planning/modules/{module_name}/`:

| File | Created By | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `CONTEXT.md` | `/odoo-gsd:discuss-module` | Implementation decisions from human Q&A |
| `RESEARCH.md` | `/odoo-gsd:new-erp` or manual | OCA research, pattern analysis |
| `spec.json` | `/odoo-gsd:plan-module` | Full module specification sent to belt |
| `coherence-report.json` | `/odoo-gsd:plan-module` | Cross-module coherence check results |
| `generation-manifest.json` | Belt (odoo-gen) | What the belt produced: files, models, tests |
| `check-report.json` | `/odoo-gsd:check-module` | 4-level checker results |

---

## 4. Configuration Extension

GSD's `.planning/config.json` schema is extended:

```json
{
  "mode": "interactive",
  "depth": "standard",
  "profile": "quality",
  "git": {
    "auto_commit": true,
    "conventional_commits": true
  },
  "odoo": {
    "version": "17.0",
    "multi_company": true,
    "localization": "pk",
    "belt_install_path": "~/.claude/odoo-gen",
    "default_depends": ["base", "mail"],
    "security_framework": "dynamic_rbac",
    "scope_levels": ["institution", "campus", "faculty", "department", "program"],
    "notification_channels": ["email", "whatsapp"],
    "canvas_integration": true,
    "docker_image": "odoo:17.0",
    "addons_path": "./addons",
    "test_db": "odoo_test",
    "python_path": "python3"
  }
}
```

**Validation rules** (added to `bin/lib/config.js`):
- `odoo.version` must be "17.0" or "18.0"
- `odoo.scope_levels` must be non-empty array of strings
- `odoo.belt_install_path` must exist on filesystem
- `odoo.notification_channels` elements must be from ["email", "whatsapp", "sms"]

---

## 5. Belt Invocation Pattern

This is the critical integration point. GSD's `Task()` mechanism spawns subagents with fresh context. odoo-gsd uses this to invoke odoo-gen.

### 5.1 How GSD spawns subagents (existing pattern)

```
Task(
  prompt: "...",
  subagent_type: "executor",
  model_profile: "quality"
)
```

The agent reads from `.planning/` files, writes output files, and exits. Orchestrator reads the output files.

### 5.2 How odoo-gsd invokes the belt

```
# Step 1: Prepare belt input
Write spec.json with _available_models injected from registry
Write belt-context.md with module-specific instructions

# Step 2: Invoke belt pipeline as fresh Task()
Task(
  prompt: "Generate Odoo module from spec.json. Follow /odoo-gen:generate workflow.
           Read spec.json at .planning/modules/{module}/spec.json.
           Write output to addons/{module_name}/",
  subagent_type: "executor",
  model_profile: "quality"
)

# Step 3: Collect results
Read addons/{module_name}/__manifest__.py → verify generation
Parse generation-manifest.json from belt
Update model_registry.json with new models/fields
Commit: "feat({module_name}): generate module from spec v{version}"
```

### 5.3 Registry update after generation

The belt's generation manifest contains the models it created. odoo-gsd parses this and updates the registry:

```
# In generate-module workflow, after belt Task() returns:
1. Read generation-manifest.json from belt output
2. For each model in manifest:
   a. If model exists in registry → merge fields (belt output wins for new fields)
   b. If model is new → add to registry
3. Update security_groups if new groups created
4. Update computation_chains if chain steps completed
5. Bump registry version
6. Write updated registry atomically (write to .tmp, rename)
```

---

## 6. CLAUDE.md Specification

The forked CLAUDE.md is the most critical file — it's what Claude Code reads first. It must communicate:

```markdown
# odoo-gsd

Odoo ERP module orchestrator. Fork of GSD specialized for generating production-ready
Odoo modules at scale from a university ERP PRD.

## Architecture

Three layers:
1. **odoo-gsd** (this system) — orchestration, decomposition, cross-module state
2. **odoo-gen** (extension at ~/.claude/odoo-gen/) — single module generation pipeline
3. **odoo-gen-utils** (Python CLI) — AST analysis, Docker validation, MCP server

## Critical State Files

- `.planning/model_registry.json` — ALL models across ALL modules. ALWAYS read before generating.
- `.planning/module_status.json` — Per-module status. Check before any module operation.
- `.planning/computation_chains.json` — Cross-module computation chains.
- `.planning/security_scope.json` — Dynamic RBAC configuration.
- `.planning/config.json` — Project config including `odoo` block.

## Commands

/odoo-gsd:new-erp         — Initialize ERP project, decompose PRD into modules
/odoo-gsd:map-erp         — Scan existing Odoo codebase, populate registry
/odoo-gsd:discuss-module   — Module-specific implementation questions
/odoo-gsd:plan-module      — Generate spec.json, run coherence check
/odoo-gsd:generate-module  — Invoke belt, update registry
/odoo-gsd:check-module     — Run 4-level checker
/odoo-gsd:audit-erp        — Full ERP integration audit
/odoo-gsd:progress         — Module status + registry stats
/odoo-gsd:quick            — Quick field/bug/view without full cycle
/odoo-gsd:complete-phase   — Archive tier, tag release
/odoo-gsd:pause-work       — Save context and pause
/odoo-gsd:resume-work      — Reload registry and resume
/odoo-gsd:debug            — Debug with Odoo context
/odoo-gsd:settings         — Edit config including Odoo settings
/odoo-gsd:help             — Show all commands

## Rules

1. NEVER generate Odoo code directly. Always invoke through the belt (odoo-gen).
2. ALWAYS read model_registry.json before planning or generating a module.
3. ALWAYS update model_registry.json after successful generation.
4. ALWAYS run coherence check before presenting spec to human.
5. Module generation order follows dependency tiers. Never generate a module before its dependencies.
6. Human approval required at: spec review, generation review, check sign-off.
7. One module at a time through the belt. Parallel only within same tier, one belt invocation at a time.
```

`bin/install.js` modifications:
- Package name: `odoo-gsd`
- Install path: `~/.claude/odoo-gsd/`
- Remove multi-runtime support (OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex) — Claude Code only
- Add dependency checks:
  - Node.js >= 16.7.0 (keep from GSD)
  - Python 3.8+ (for odoo-gen-utils)
  - odoo-gen installed at `~/.claude/odoo-gen/` (warn if missing, offer install instructions)
  - Docker (optional, for integration testing)

## 10. Open Questions

1. **Belt manifest format:** The exact schema of `generation-manifest.json` that odoo-gen produces needs to be documented/standardized for reliable registry updates. Currently inferred from belt codebase analysis.

2. **Registry size vs context window:** As the registry grows (20+ modules, 100+ models), it may exceed practical context injection size. May need: selective injection (only models relevant to current module's depends), registry summarization, or tiered injection (full for direct depends, summary for transitive).

3. **Parallel module generation:** Modules within the same tier can theoretically run in parallel, but each belt invocation needs exclusive access to the addons directory and Docker. May need: per-module working directories, merge step after parallel generation.

4. **Error recovery:** When a module fails generation after 3 belt retries, the current plan is skip + manual fix. Need to define: how does a skipped module affect downstream modules that depend on it? Stub models in registry?

5. **Brownfield integration:** `/odoo-gsd:map-erp` can scan existing modules, but what happens when a generated module needs to extend an existing third-party module (e.g., hr_payroll)? The registry needs to include base Odoo and OCA module models, not just generated ones.
