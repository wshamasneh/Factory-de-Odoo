# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05)

**Core value:** Cross-module coherence -- every generated Odoo module must be referentially consistent with all other modules
**Current focus:** Phase 3: Module Discussion

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 5 (Spec Generation and Coherence)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-05 -- Completed 04-01 (Coherence Checker Library)

Progress: [████████░░] 83%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 8min
- Total execution time: 0.13 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1 | 8min | 8min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 8min
- Trend: starting

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Fork GSD rather than extend (deep structural changes needed)
- Sequential module generation (belt needs exclusive Docker access)
- Tiered registry injection from day one (context window management)
- Renamed all gsd- prefixes to odoo-gsd- for full identity separation (Phase 1, Plan 1)
- Config directory changed from .gsd/ to .odoo-gsd/ (Phase 1, Plan 1)
- install.js rewritten as Claude-Code-only, 407 LOC (Phase 1, Plan 1)
- [Phase 1]: Inline atomicWriteJSON in module-status.cjs for module independence
- [Phase 1]: Tier grouping by dependency depth: 0=foundation, 1=core, 2=operations, 3+=communication
- [Phase 1]: Registry uses direct function exports for unit testing (avoids process.exit)
- [Phase 1]: Odoo config block opt-in, version stored as string 17.0/18.0
- [Phase 2]: Recursive BFS for transitive deps (all reachable, not just depth 2)
- [Phase 2]: whatsapp added to global VALID_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS
- [Phase 02]: Agent skills follow odoo-gsd-*-workflow naming convention per test suite
- [Phase 02]: Decomposition merge as standalone CJS module for testability
- [Phase 02]: Computation chains attached by step prefix matching
- [Phase 03]: Questioner agent presents 1-2 questions at a time with context hints
- [Phase 03]: Researcher enhanced in-place with 4 new sections preserving OCA checker
- [Phase 03]: 10 questions per domain type, 8 for generic; question IDs follow {type}_{short_name} pattern
- [Phase 03]: Workflow uses subagent_type for agent spawning (no read-agent-file workaround)
- [Phase 03]: Module type detection: exact match -> prefix+underscore -> null (ask user)
- [Phase 04]: BASE_ODOO_MODELS includes 20 common models; base.group_* prefix auto-allowed for security
- [Phase 04]: Spec models is array, registry models is object -- handled consistently in all 4 checks
- [Phase 04]: Spec generator uses single-pass output for all 12 sections to avoid partial spec states
- [Phase 04]: Spec reviewer is read-only (no Write tool) -- presentation agent pattern
- [Phase 04]: Workflow supports re-running on spec_approved modules with user confirmation
- [Phase 04]: Skip option allows jumping to coherence check if spec.json already exists
- [Phase 04]: Revise loops back to Step 5 (researcher) for full re-generation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- odoo-gen belt is not installed -- all belt integration (Phase 5) built against mock/assumptions
- Belt manifest schema undefined -- adapter pattern needed for Phase 5
