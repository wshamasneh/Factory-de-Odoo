# Requirements: odoo-gsd

**Defined:** 2026-03-05
**Core Value:** Cross-module coherence — every generated Odoo module must be referentially consistent with all other modules

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Fork Foundation

- [x] **FORK-01**: All 32 command files renamed from `/gsd:` to `/odoo-gsd:` prefix with zero remaining `/gsd:` references
- [x] **FORK-02**: All workflow files updated to reference `odoo-gsd` commands instead of `gsd` commands
- [x] **FORK-03**: All agent files updated to reference `odoo-gsd` paths and commands
- [x] **FORK-04**: 233+ hardcoded path references to `get-shit-done` renamed to `odoo-gsd` across all files
- [x] **FORK-05**: `bin/install.js` rewritten for Claude Code only (remove OpenCode, Gemini, Codex runtime support)
- [x] **FORK-06**: `bin/install.js` checks for odoo-gen at `~/.claude/odoo-gen/` (warn if missing, offer instructions)
- [x] **FORK-07**: `bin/install.js` checks for Python 3.8+ (required by odoo-gen-utils)
- [x] **FORK-08**: `CLAUDE.md` rewritten as Odoo ERP orchestrator context document with command reference, architecture description, state file locations, and rules
- [x] **FORK-09**: `package.json` renamed to `odoo-gsd` with updated description and repository URL

- [x] **REG-06**: Registry stats command returns model count, field count, cross-module reference count
- [x] **REG-07**: CLI subcommands registered: `registry read`, `registry read-model`, `registry update`, `registry rollback`, `registry validate`, `registry stats`
- [x] **REG-08**: Tiered registry injection implemented (full models for direct depends, field-list-only for transitive depends, names-only for rest)

### Module Status

- [x] **STAT-01**: `module_status.json` state file created with per-module status and tier structure
- [x] **STAT-02**: Module status transitions enforced (planned -> spec_approved -> generated -> checked -> shipped) with invalid transition rejection
- [x] **STAT-03**: Tier status computed from constituent module statuses (complete when all modules shipped)
- [x] **STAT-04**: Per-module artifact directory created at `.planning/modules/{module_name}/` with CONTEXT.md, spec.json, coherence-report.json, generation-manifest.json, check-report.json slots

- [x] **DEPG-05**: Generation blocked if a module's dependencies have not reached "generated" status

### PRD Decomposition (new-erp)

- [x] **NWRP-01**: `/odoo-gsd:new-erp` command and workflow created
- [x] **NWRP-02**: Odoo-specific config questions asked at project init (version, multi_company, localization, module scope, notification channels, deployment target)

### Module Discussion (discuss-module)

- [x] **DISC-01**: `/odoo-gsd:discuss-module` command and workflow created
- [x] **DISC-02**: Module type detected from name/description (fee, exam, student, faculty, HR, timetable, notification, portal, core)
- [x] **DISC-03**: Module-type-specific question templates loaded (fee: monetary vs float, penalty method, payment channels; exam: grading scales, makeup policy; student: enrollment states, academic holds)
- [x] **DISC-04**: `odoo-module-questioner` agent created with per-type expertise
- [x] **DISC-05**: Q&A output written to `.planning/modules/{module}/CONTEXT.md`

### Spec Generation (plan-module)

- [x] **SPEC-01**: `/odoo-gsd:plan-module` command and workflow created
- [x] **SPEC-02**: `odoo-spec-generator` agent created that produces spec.json from CONTEXT.md + RESEARCH.md + registry

- [x] **SPEC-04**: `_available_models` injected from registry into spec.json (using tiered injection)
- [x] **SPEC-05**: `odoo-coherence-checker` agent created that validates spec against registry
- [x] **SPEC-06**: Coherence check validates: Many2one targets exist in registry, no duplicate model names, computed field depends chains have sources, security groups are defined
- [x] **SPEC-07**: Coherence report presented to human with pass/fail per check

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Parallel module generation | Docker exclusivity, registry race conditions, complexity outweighs benefit at 20 modules |
| Direct Odoo code generation | Belt (odoo-gen) handles code gen; orchestrator orchestrates only |
| Auto-fix failed modules | Silent fixes create insidious bugs; human must decide retry/revise/skip |
| Real-time registry sync via XML-RPC | Registry is build artifact, not runtime mirror; adds fragile runtime dependency |
| Multi-runtime support (OpenCode, Gemini, Codex) | Task() subagent pattern is Claude Code specific and foundational |
| GUI dashboard | Massive scope increase for CLI tool used by one team; enhance progress command instead |
| Automatic dependency resolution | Silent dependency addition risks circular deps and bloat; coherence checker flags, human adds |
| Full base Odoo model pre-population | 200+ models adds noise; on-demand scanning (v2) is sufficient |
| odoo-gen belt development | Separate repo, separate concern |
| odoo-gen-utils Python CLI | Separate repo, separate concern |
