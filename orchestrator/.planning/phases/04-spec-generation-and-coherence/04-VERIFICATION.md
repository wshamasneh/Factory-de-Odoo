# Phase 4: Spec Generation and Coherence Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** User can generate a complete spec.json for any module from its CONTEXT.md and registry context, have it validated for cross-module coherence, review the results, and approve the spec before generation proceeds
**Verified:** 2026-03-06T12:00:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No -- initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Running `/odoo-gsd:plan-module {module}` produces a spec.json with all 12 sections plus _available_models | VERIFIED | `commands/odoo-gsd/plan-module.md` exists with correct frontmatter (name, argument-hint, allowed-tools including Task/AskUserQuestion). Workflow `odoo-gsd/workflows/plan-module.md` (277 lines) has all 10 steps. Step 7 spawns spec-generator agent which covers all 12 sections. Step 7 post-validation checks all 12 required keys. |
| 2 | Registry context is injected into spec.json as `_available_models` using tiered injection | VERIFIED | Workflow Step 6 invokes `registry tiered-injection` CLI. Empty registry fallback handled with `{"direct": {}, "transitive": {}, "rest": []}`. Spec generator agent writes `_available_models` from tiered registry input. |
| 3 | Coherence checker validates Many2one targets, duplicate models, computed depends, security groups -- presenting pass/fail report | VERIFIED | `coherence.cjs` (285 lines) exports all 4 checks + `runAllChecks` + `cmdCoherenceCheck` + `BASE_ODOO_MODELS`. CLI registered at line 652 of `odoo-gsd-tools.cjs`. Output format matches locked JSON schema. 449-line test suite with 33 tests covers all checks, edge cases, and CLI integration. |
| 4 | Human approves the spec and module status transitions to "spec_approved" | VERIFIED | Workflow Step 9 spawns spec-reviewer agent for presentation. Step 10 uses AskUserQuestion with approve/revise/abort options. On approve, invokes `module-status transition ${MODULE} spec_approved`. Revise loops to Step 5. |
| 5 | Coherence tests pass covering Many2one validation, computation chain integrity, and spec coverage | VERIFIED | `tests/coherence.test.cjs` has 33 tests covering: Many2one/Many2many/One2many targets, BASE_ODOO_MODELS passthrough, duplicate models, computed depends with dot-notation, security group validation, runAllChecks aggregation, CLI integration. All pass (743/743 total suite). |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| None | - | - | - | No anti-patterns detected |

No TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholders, empty implementations, or console.log-only handlers found in any phase artifacts.

### Human Verification Required

### 1. End-to-End Pipeline Execution

**Test:** Run `/odoo-gsd:plan-module {module}` on a real module with CONTEXT.md
**Expected:** Pipeline progresses through all 10 steps, produces spec.json, runs coherence check, presents review, offers approval
**Why human:** Requires live Claude Code environment with Task() agent spawning and AskUserQuestion interaction

### 2. Spec Generator Output Quality

**Test:** Verify spec generator agent produces well-structured Odoo-specific spec.json from real module context
**Expected:** Models use correct Odoo field types, computation chains are logically consistent, security groups follow naming conventions
**Why human:** Quality of LLM-generated spec.json content cannot be verified programmatically

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 5 success criteria truths are verified. All 11 requirement IDs are satisfied with implementation evidence. All 9 artifacts pass existence, substantive, and wiring checks. All 9 key links are wired. No anti-patterns detected. 743/743 tests pass.
