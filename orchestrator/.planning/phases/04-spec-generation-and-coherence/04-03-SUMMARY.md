provides:
  - plan-module slash command entry point
  - 10-step workflow orchestrating researcher, spec generator, coherence, reviewer, approval
  - Structural validation tests for command and workflow

# Phase 4 Plan 3: Plan-Module Pipeline Summary

**Plan-module slash command with 10-step workflow orchestrating researcher, spec generator, coherence checker, reviewer, and human approval into end-to-end spec.json pipeline**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-05T19:16:44Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-05T19:19:06Z
- **Tasks:** 2 (+ 1 auto-approved checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Created plan-module slash command following discuss-module pattern with Task and AskUserQuestion tools
- Created 10-step workflow linking all Phase 4 components: researcher agent, tiered registry, spec generator, coherence checker CLI, spec reviewer, human approval with module-status transition
- 35 structural validation tests across 4 suites; 743 total tests pass with zero regressions

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create plan-module slash command and workflow** - `b680498` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create plan-module structural validation tests** - `d8bb4c0` (test)

## Files Created/Modified
- `commands/odoo-gsd/plan-module.md` - Slash command entry point routing to workflow
- `odoo-gsd/workflows/plan-module.md` - 10-step workflow with full pipeline orchestration
- `tests/plan-module.test.cjs` - 35 structural tests: command structure, workflow completeness, schema coverage, registry injection

## Decisions Made
- Workflow supports re-running on modules already at spec_approved status (with user confirmation to overwrite)
- Skip option when spec.json exists allows jumping directly to coherence check at Step 8
- Revise option in approval step loops back to Step 5 (researcher) for full re-generation cycle

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Complete spec generation pipeline ready for end-to-end use
- All Phase 4 components integrated: coherence checker, spec generator agent, spec reviewer agent, plan-module workflow
- Ready for Phase 5 belt integration
