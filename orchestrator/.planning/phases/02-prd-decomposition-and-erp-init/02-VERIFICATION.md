# Phase 2: PRD Decomposition and ERP Init Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** User can initialize an Odoo ERP project from a PRD, have it decomposed into modules by parallel research agents, review the dependency graph, and approve a tiered roadmap with modules as phases
**Verified:** 2026-03-05T18:10:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No -- initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths (from ROADMAP.md Success Criteria)

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Running `/odoo-gsd:new-erp` asks Odoo-specific config questions and writes the `odoo` block to config.json | VERIFIED | `commands/odoo-gsd/new-erp.md` exists with correct frontmatter, references `workflows/new-erp.md`; workflow Stage A has 7 config questions each calling `config-set odoo.*` (7 occurrences found); `config.cjs` validates all new keys (VALID_LOCALIZATIONS, VALID_LMS_INTEGRATIONS, VALID_DEPLOYMENT_TARGETS, whatsapp in VALID_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS) |
| 2 | Four parallel research agents analyze the PRD and produce a merged module dependency graph with tier assignments | VERIFIED | Workflow Stage B spawns 4 Task() agents (2 dedicated + 2 inline); `agents/odoo-gsd-erp-decomposer.md` outputs `module-boundaries.json`; `agents/odoo-gsd-module-researcher.md` outputs `oca-analysis.json`; inline agents produce `dependency-map.json` and `computation-chains.json`; `decomposition.cjs` mergeDecomposition() reads all 4 and runs topoSort/computeTiers (4 references to dependency-graph functions); 8 tests pass |
| 3 | Human is presented with the module decomposition for review and can approve or request changes before roadmap generation | VERIFIED | Workflow Stage C contains structured presentation format, 6 references to approve/modify/regenerate flow; `formatDecompositionTable()` produces tier-grouped table; `module-status init` called on approval (1 occurrence in workflow) |
| 4 | Tiered registry injection works (full models for direct depends, field-list for transitive, names-only for rest) | VERIFIED | `tieredRegistryInjection` function defined and exported in `registry.cjs`; imports `readStatusFile` from `module-status.cjs` (1 require reference); 261 lines of tests in `tests/tiered-registry.test.cjs`; all tests pass with 0 failures |

**Score:** 4/4 truths verified

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| CONF-03 | 02-01 | new-erp collects Odoo-specific config via interactive questions | SATISFIED | Workflow Stage A has 7 questions writing to config.json; config.cjs validates all new keys |

No orphaned requirements found -- all 9 requirement IDs from ROADMAP.md Phase 2 are covered by plans.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| (none) | - | - | - | No TODO, FIXME, PLACEHOLDER, empty returns, or stub patterns found |

### Human Verification Required

### 1. End-to-End new-erp Command Flow

**Test:** Run `/odoo-gsd:new-erp` with a sample PRD document
**Expected:** 7 config questions asked sequentially, each writing to config.json; 4 agents spawn and produce JSON files; merge creates decomposition.json; tiered table presented; approve flow works; modules initialized; ROADMAP.md generated
**Why human:** Full workflow requires interactive Claude Code session with Task() subagent spawning -- cannot verify programmatically

### 2. Agent Output Quality

**Test:** Review the JSON outputs from the 4 research agents on a real university ERP PRD
**Expected:** Module boundaries use uni_ prefix, OCA analysis has actionable recommendations, dependency map is acyclic, computation chains identify cross-module flows
**Why human:** Agent prompt quality and output correctness require domain expertise evaluation
