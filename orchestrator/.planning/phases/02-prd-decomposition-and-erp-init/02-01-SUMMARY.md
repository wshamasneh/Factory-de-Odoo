# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01-fork-foundation-and-state-infrastructure
    provides: registry.cjs CRUD, module-status.cjs readStatusFile, config.cjs validateOdooConfigKey
provides:
  - tieredRegistryInjection() function for context-window-optimized spec generation
  - Extended odoo config validation for new-erp interactive questions
affects: [02-02, 02-03, spec-generation, new-erp-command]

# Phase 2 Plan 1: Tiered Registry Injection and Config Validation Summary

**tieredRegistryInjection() with 3-tier dependency filtering (full/field-list/names-only) and 6 new odoo config validation rules including whatsapp channel**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-05T17:36:06Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-05T17:39:21Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- tieredRegistryInjection() returns context-optimized model data based on dependency distance
- Recursive BFS traversal computes all transitive dependencies (not just depth 2)
- 6 new odoo config keys validated: multi_company, localization, canvas_integration, deployment_target, notification_channels (whatsapp), existing_modules
- 30 new tests added (9 tiered injection + 21 config), full suite 617 passing

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Tiered registry injection function with tests** - `88c15a8` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Extend config validation for new Odoo keys** - `4b842a6` (feat)

_Both tasks followed TDD: RED (failing tests) -> GREEN (implementation) -> verify full suite_

## Files Created/Modified
- `odoo-gsd/bin/lib/registry.cjs` - Added tieredRegistryInjection() with BFS transitive dep computation
- `odoo-gsd/bin/lib/config.cjs` - Added VALID_LOCALIZATIONS, VALID_LMS_INTEGRATIONS, VALID_DEPLOYMENT_TARGETS; whatsapp to VALID_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS; 5 new validation cases
- `tests/tiered-registry.test.cjs` - 9 tests covering all 3 tiers, recursive traversal, edge cases
- `tests/config.test.cjs` - 21 new tests for CONF-03 validation rules

## Decisions Made
- Recursive BFS for transitive deps (all reachable modules, not just depth 2) -- small module count makes this cheap
- whatsapp added to the global VALID_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS constant rather than a separate new-erp-specific set

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- tieredRegistryInjection ready for spec generation workflows
- Config validation ready for the 7 interactive questions in new-erp command (Plan 02-02)
- All existing tests continue to pass (617/617)
