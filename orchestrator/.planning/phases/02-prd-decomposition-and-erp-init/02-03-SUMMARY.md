# Phase 2 Plan 03: Decomposition Merge and Approval Summary

**5-step merge of 4 agent JSON outputs into decomposition.json with tiered presentation, human approval loop, module initialization, and flat ROADMAP.md generation**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-05T17:46:21Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-05T17:49:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Standalone decomposition.cjs with 3 exported functions (mergeDecomposition, formatDecompositionTable, generateRoadmapMarkdown)
- 8 unit tests covering all merge steps, annotation, topo sort, chain attachment, warnings, formatting, and ROADMAP output
- Complete new-erp workflow with Stage A + B + C (6 steps: merge, present, approve/modify/regenerate, init modules, generate ROADMAP, summary)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Merge logic tests and extractable merge function** - `9309489` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Complete new-erp workflow Stage C** - `146ab9d` (feat)

_Note: Task 1 used TDD (test + impl in single GREEN commit)_

## Files Created/Modified
- `odoo-gsd/bin/lib/decomposition.cjs` - 5-step merge, table formatter, ROADMAP generator (190 lines)
- `tests/new-erp.test.cjs` - 8 tests with fixture data for 4-module ERP
- `odoo-gsd/workflows/new-erp.md` - Stage C added (merge, approval, module init, ROADMAP)

## Decisions Made
- Decomposition merge extracted as standalone CJS module for unit testability (workflow calls it via node -e)
- Computation chains attached by matching step prefix to module name (e.g., "uni_student.enrollment" matches "uni_student")
- Reused TIER_LABELS constant pattern from dependency-graph.cjs

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
- node:test `before` hook needed explicit import (not auto-available like describe/it) -- fixed immediately

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- new-erp workflow complete (Stage A + B + C)
- Ready for Phase 3 execution (module generation workflows)
- decomposition.cjs provides all merge/format/roadmap functions needed downstream
