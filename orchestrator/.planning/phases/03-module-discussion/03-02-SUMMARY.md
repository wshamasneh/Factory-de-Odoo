# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 02-prd-decomposition
    provides: Existing odoo-gsd-module-researcher agent and agent-frontmatter.test.cjs validation
provides:
  - odoo-gsd-module-questioner agent for interactive module Q&A
  - Enhanced researcher agent with per-domain Odoo expertise
affects: [03-module-discussion, 04-plan-module]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: [AskUserQuestion tool]
  patterns: [adaptive Q&A flow, per-domain knowledge sections, dual-purpose agent]

key-files:
  created: [agents/odoo-gsd-module-questioner.md]
  modified: [agents/odoo-gsd-module-researcher.md]

key-decisions:
  - "Questioner agent presents 1-2 questions at a time with context hints"
  - "Researcher enhanced in-place with 4 new sections preserving OCA checker"

patterns-established:
  - "Adaptive agent pattern: use question template as guide, skip/add based on config context"
  - "Dual-purpose agent: same agent file serves multiple workflows via different input modes"

# Phase 3 Plan 2: Questioner Agent and Researcher Enhancement Summary

**Interactive questioner agent with AskUserQuestion tool and researcher agent enhanced with field type, security, view inheritance, and domain pitfall knowledge**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-05T18:28:59Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-05T18:31:13Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Created odoo-gsd-module-questioner agent with AskUserQuestion tool for interactive module discussion
- Enhanced odoo-gsd-module-researcher with 4 new Odoo knowledge sections (field types, security, views, pitfalls)
- Both agents pass all 62 agent-frontmatter tests

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create odoo-gsd-module-questioner agent** - `d450651` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Enhance researcher agent with per-domain Odoo knowledge** - `98cc133` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `agents/odoo-gsd-module-questioner.md` - Interactive Q&A agent with adaptive questioning, CONTEXT.md output template
- `agents/odoo-gsd-module-researcher.md` - Enhanced with field type recommendations, security patterns, view inheritance, domain pitfalls

## Decisions Made
- Questioner agent uses 1-2 questions at a time pattern with config-aware skipping
- Researcher enhanced in-place preserving all OCA checker functionality for Phase 2 compatibility

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Questioner agent ready for discuss-module workflow integration (Plan 03)
- Enhanced researcher ready for Phase 4 plan-module workflow
- Both agents validated by existing test suite
