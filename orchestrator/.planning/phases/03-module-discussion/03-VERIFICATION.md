# Phase 3: Module Discussion Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** User can run an interactive discussion for any module that asks domain-specific questions based on module type, producing a rich CONTEXT.md that captures design decisions before spec generation
**Verified:** 2026-03-05T19:00:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No -- initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | module-questions.json contains all 10 module types with 8-12 questions each | VERIFIED | 10 types confirmed (core:10, student:10, fee:10, exam:10, faculty:10, hr:10, timetable:10, notification:10, portal:10, generic:8). JSON parses cleanly. |
| 2 | Each question object has id, question, and context fields | VERIFIED | Test `TMPL: each question has required fields` passes across all 98 questions |
| 3 | Type detection from module name returns correct type for all 9 known prefixes and null for unknown | VERIFIED | Tests cover exact matches (uni_fee->fee), sub-module matches (uni_fee_structure->fee), and null fallback (custom_thing->null) |
| 4 | odoo-gsd-module-questioner agent exists with AskUserQuestion in tools | VERIFIED | Agent file has `tools: Read, Write, Bash, AskUserQuestion` in frontmatter, 98 lines, skills field present |
| 5 | odoo-gsd-module-researcher agent enhanced with per-domain Odoo knowledge sections | VERIFIED | Contains field type recommendations, security pattern lookup, view inheritance patterns, Odoo pitfalls per domain sections. 149 lines. Original OCA checker preserved. |
| 6 | /odoo-gsd:discuss-module command routes to workflow which detects type, loads template, spawns questioner agent | VERIFIED | Command references `workflows/discuss-module.md`, workflow contains `subagent_type="odoo-gsd-module-questioner"` and reads `module-questions.json` |
| 7 | Workflow validates module exists in module_status.json at planned status before proceeding | VERIFIED | Step 1 in workflow calls `module-status get` and checks for "planned" status with clear error messages |

**Score:** 7/7 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `odoo-gsd/references/module-questions.json` | Question templates for all module types | VERIFIED | 778 lines, 10 types, 98 total questions, valid JSON |
| `tests/discuss-module.test.cjs` | Test coverage for templates, type detection, command, workflow, agents | VERIFIED | 239 lines, 21 tests across 6 describe blocks, all passing |
| `agents/odoo-gsd-module-questioner.md` | Questioner agent with AskUserQuestion | VERIFIED | 98 lines (min 60), has AskUserQuestion in tools, skills field, CONTEXT.md template |
| `agents/odoo-gsd-module-researcher.md` | Enhanced researcher with field type, security, view inheritance | VERIFIED | 149 lines (min 80), contains all 4 enhanced sections, OCA checker preserved |
| `commands/odoo-gsd/discuss-module.md` | Slash command for discuss-module | VERIFIED | 31 lines (min 15), name: odoo-gsd:discuss-module, allowed-tools includes Task and AskUserQuestion |
| `odoo-gsd/workflows/discuss-module.md` | Workflow orchestrating type detection, template loading, agent spawning | VERIFIED | 146 lines (min 80), 7-step workflow, references questioner agent via subagent_type |

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `commands/odoo-gsd/discuss-module.md` | `odoo-gsd/workflows/discuss-module.md` | execution_context reference | WIRED | Line 26: `@~/.claude/odoo-gsd/workflows/discuss-module.md` |
| `odoo-gsd/workflows/discuss-module.md` | `agents/odoo-gsd-module-questioner.md` | Task() spawn with subagent_type | WIRED | Line 125: `subagent_type="odoo-gsd-module-questioner"` |
| `odoo-gsd/workflows/discuss-module.md` | `odoo-gsd/references/module-questions.json` | Read tool to load question template | WIRED | Line 68: `Read odoo-gsd/references/module-questions.json` |
| `tests/discuss-module.test.cjs` | `odoo-gsd/references/module-questions.json` | fs.readFileSync and JSON.parse | WIRED | Test file reads and parses the JSON file in TMPL tests |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| DISC-01 | 03-03 | `/odoo-gsd:discuss-module` command and workflow created | SATISFIED | `commands/odoo-gsd/discuss-module.md` and `odoo-gsd/workflows/discuss-module.md` both exist and are wired |
| DISC-02 | 03-01 | Module type detected from name/description | SATISFIED | Type detection in workflow Step 3 with 9 known prefixes, sub-module matching, and null fallback |
| DISC-03 | 03-01 | Module-type-specific question templates loaded | SATISFIED | `module-questions.json` has 10 types with domain-specific questions (fee: monetary vs float; exam: grading scales; etc.) |
| DISC-04 | 03-02 | `odoo-module-questioner` agent created with per-type expertise | SATISFIED | `agents/odoo-gsd-module-questioner.md` with AskUserQuestion tool, adaptive questioning instructions |
| DISC-05 | 03-03 | Q&A output written to `.planning/modules/{module}/CONTEXT.md` | SATISFIED | Questioner agent instructions specify writing to `.planning/modules/{MODULE_NAME}/CONTEXT.md` with structured template |
| AGNT-01 | 03-02 | `researcher.md` agent specialized for Odoo research | SATISFIED | Enhanced with field type, security pattern, view inheritance, and domain pitfall sections |

No orphaned requirements found -- all 6 requirement IDs (DISC-01 through DISC-05, AGNT-01) are accounted for in plans and verified.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| (none) | - | - | - | No anti-patterns detected |

No TODO, FIXME, PLACEHOLDER, or stub patterns found in any phase artifacts. No empty implementations or console.log-only handlers.

### Human Verification Required

### 1. Interactive Q&A Flow

**Test:** Run `/odoo-gsd:discuss-module uni_fee` on a project with module_status.json containing uni_fee at "planned" status
**Expected:** Workflow detects "fee" type, confirms with user, loads fee-specific questions (monetary vs float, payment channels, etc.), spawns questioner agent that asks 1-2 questions at a time via AskUserQuestion, writes CONTEXT.md
**Why human:** End-to-end flow requires interactive user input via AskUserQuestion tool, module_status.json state, and agent spawning -- cannot be verified statically

### 2. Adaptive Question Skipping

**Test:** During discussion, provide answers that should cause follow-up questions to be skipped (e.g., "no payment gateway")
**Expected:** Questioner agent explains why questions are being skipped and adapts remaining questions accordingly
**Why human:** Adaptive behavior depends on agent reasoning and real-time user input

### 3. CONTEXT.md Output Quality

**Test:** Complete a full discussion session and review the generated CONTEXT.md
**Expected:** Structured document with Design Decisions sections, Odoo-Specific Choices, and Open Questions -- matching the template in the agent instructions
**Why human:** Output quality and completeness depends on agent behavior during interactive session

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 7 observable truths verified. All 6 artifacts exist, are substantive (well above minimum line counts), and are properly wired. All 6 requirements satisfied. All 658 tests pass (21 phase-specific, zero regressions). No anti-patterns detected.

The phase goal is achieved: the system provides a complete pipeline from slash command through workflow to questioner agent, with domain-specific question templates for all 10 module types, producing structured CONTEXT.md output. The only items requiring human verification are the interactive agent behaviors that depend on real-time user input.
