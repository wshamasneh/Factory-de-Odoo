provides:
  - "Model registry CRUD with atomic writes, versioning, rollback"
  - "Registry validation (Many2one targets, One2many inverse_name, model name format)"
  - "Registry stats (model count, field count, cross-module references)"
  - "Odoo config block with version validation (17.0/18.0)"
  - "6 registry CLI subcommands dispatched from odoo-gsd-tools.cjs"

key-decisions:
  - "Registry uses direct function exports (not CLI integration tests) for unit testing to avoid process.exit"
  - "Odoo config block is opt-in: only present when explicitly set, does not appear in default config"
  - "odoo.version stored as string to preserve '17.0' format (not coerced to number 17)"
  - "Validation checks model name format via /^[a-z][a-z0-9_.]+$/ regex"

patterns-established:
  - "Atomic write pattern: copyFileSync to .bak, writeFileSync to .tmp, renameSync .tmp to target"
  - "Registry module pattern: internal functions for unit testing + cmd* wrappers for CLI"
  - "Odoo config validation: validate before set, preserve string types for version"

# Phase 1 Plan 2: Config Extension and Model Registry Summary

**Model registry with atomic writes, versioning, rollback, validation, stats, and odoo config block with version validation (17.0/18.0)**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-05T16:47:15Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-05T16:52:30Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments
- Created registry.cjs (~270 LOC) with full CRUD: read, read-model, update, rollback, validate, stats
- Atomic write pattern ensures data integrity (backup to .bak, write to .tmp, rename to target)
- Registry validation catches: invalid Many2one targets, missing inverse_name on One2many, duplicate model names, invalid model name format
- Extended config.cjs with odoo block validation (version must be 17.0/18.0, scope_levels must be non-empty array, notification_channels from allowed set)
- Added 17 registry tests and 4 config tests (all passing, 589 total)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Odoo config block extension and registry.cjs with tests** - `645b4e2` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Register registry CLI subcommands in dispatcher** - `20c39fa` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `odoo-gsd/bin/lib/registry.cjs` - Model registry CRUD with atomic writes, versioning, rollback, validation, stats
- `odoo-gsd/bin/lib/config.cjs` - Extended with odoo config block validation
- `odoo-gsd/bin/odoo-gsd-tools.cjs` - Added registry case with 6 subcommands
- `tests/registry.test.cjs` - 17 tests covering REG-01 through REG-06
- `tests/config.test.cjs` - 4 new tests for odoo config block (CONF-01, CONF-02)

## Decisions Made
- Registry uses direct function exports for unit testing (avoids process.exit in test context)
- Odoo config block is opt-in per research recommendation (not in default config)
- odoo.version stored as string "17.0" to preserve format (JS number coercion would lose ".0")
- Model name validation uses `/^[a-z][a-z0-9_.]+$/` matching Odoo convention

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Model registry is operational and ready for Phase 2 spec generation
- All 6 CLI subcommands dispatch correctly
- Config supports odoo-specific settings for version and scope control
- Atomic write pattern established for safe concurrent access

## Self-Check: PASSED

All files verified present. Commits 645b4e2 and 20c39fa confirmed in git log.
